Twixt is board game where players take turns placing pegs on a 24X24 grid. The object of the game is 
to "connect" pegs from opposite sides. Red travels horizontally and blue travels vertically. Only 
the matching color can play in the first or last row or column. If a player places a peg in any 
combination of 2 in one direction and 1 in a perpendicular direction (like the rook in chess) then 
a connector is placed on the board connecting the two pegs. You cannot place pegs on the same spot, 
and connectors are not allowed to overlap. You are allowed to move anywhere on the board at any time 
as long as it does not go into opponents row or column.
